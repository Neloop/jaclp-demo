Demo Spring Boot project for JACLP library.
The demo uses `Spring Security` and `Spring Data JPA` and by default runs on `H2` in-memory database.

## Run Application

The application can be compiled and run with `maven`, therefore installed `maven` on the machine is a must.
And of course `JDK` is needed, the application can be run on `Java 8+`.
After `maven` installation, run the application with:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
